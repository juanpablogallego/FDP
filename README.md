Finite Difference code

A simple finite difference application for solving hyperbolic ecuations of consevation laws. 

Grid used:                      So far a equidistant Cartesian grid is generated with arbitraty amount of points in 1, 2                                 and 3 space dimension.

Type of equations:              1D Scalar conservation laws (planning to extend it to multi-dimensional  systems).

Initial conditions implemented: Gaussian bell exp(-x^2).

Test cases implemented:         1D inviscid Burgers' equation.
